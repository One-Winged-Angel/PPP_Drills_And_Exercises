Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ – Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the exercises and drills from “Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++” by Bjarne Stroustrup.

I’m using this repo as:

A record of my progress through the book

A place to practice clean C++ code, version control, and project structure

A reference for my future self (and anyone else learning from the same book)

⚠️ Note: This repository is not an official solution set and is not affiliated with Bjarne Stroustrup or the publisher. All code here is my own work based on reading and solving the exercises.

📚 About the Book

Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ is an introductory programming book by Bjarne Stroustrup, designed to teach fundamental programming concepts through modern C++.

Focus: Core programming concepts and problem-solving

Audience: Beginners and those building a solid C++ foundation

Topics: Functions, classes, data types, templates, error handling, and general design principles

I’m working through the book chapter by chapter, implementing the drills and exercises here.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Strengthen my C++ fundamentals and general programming ability

Practice writing clean, maintainable, well-structured code

Use Git and GitHub for consistent version tracking

Create a clear record of progress through each chapter

🗂 Repository Overview

Each chapter has its own folder containing drills and exercises.

Example:

Chapter 03 – Variables, Expressions, and Statements

Chapter 04 – Computation

Chapter 05 – Errors

Chapter 06 – Writing a Program

I may refactor older solutions or add utility headers as I progress.

⚙️ Getting Started

To explore or test any of the exercises:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open your preferred IDE or terminal.

Compile and run each exercise using your C++ compiler.

Most programs are standalone single-file exercises and should build without additional dependencies.

✅ Progress Tracking

I’m tracking my progress as I move through the chapters:

Chapter 03: ✔ Drills ✔ Exercises

Chapter 04: ✔ Drills ☐ Exercises

Chapter 05: ☐ Drills ☐ Exercises

Chapter 06: ☐ Drills ☐ Exercises

Future updates will refine code quality, add comments, and improve structure as my understanding deepens.
